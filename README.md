# Battleships-Game 

 - Ultimate Battleships is a Python terminal game, which runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku

 - This is a simple implementation of the Battleships game in Python. The game allows you to play against the computer by guessing the locations of battleships on a game board.

 - The game board will be generated and the battleships will be placed randomly on the board.

 - The game board is randomly generated and the battleships are placed on the board in random positions.

 - Here is the live version of my project.

## How to Play

1. Run the code in a Python environment.
2. Enter the number of rows for the game board when prompted.
3. Enter the number of columns for the game board when prompted.
4. Enter the number of ships you want to play with when prompted.
5. For each ship, enter the width of the ship when prompted.
6. The game board will be displayed with ships randomly placed on it.
7. The game begins, and you and the computer take turns guessing the locations of each other's battleships.
8. When it's your turn, enter the row and column you want to guess.
9. If your guess hits an opponent's battleship, you will be notified, and the battleship will be marked as sunk on the game board.
10. If your guess misses, you will be notified, and the corresponding position on the game board will be marked as missed.
11. The computer will take its turn and follow the same rules.
12. The game continues until either all the battleships are sunk or the maximum number of turns is reached.
13. At the end of the game, the final game board will be displayed along with the game over message.

Have fun playing Battleships!
